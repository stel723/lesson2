        <h1>ACT 1</h1>
        <h2><em>PROLOGUE</em></h2>
        <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
        <p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
        <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
        <p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
        <p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
        <p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
        <p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
        <p>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>
        <p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
        <p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</p>
        <p>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</p>
        <p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</p>
        <p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
        <p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

        <h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
        <h4>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</h4>
        <h5>SAMPSON</h5>
        <h6>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</h6>
        <h7>GREGORY</h7>
        <h8>No, for then we should be colliers.</h8>
